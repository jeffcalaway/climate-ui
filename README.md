A user interface theme for [Climate Syntax](https://github.com/jmcalaway/climate-syntax), designed to make developing in Atom both productive and alluring. *Climate UI* adapts aesthetically based on the active file's language. Program your CSS in sky blue, your JavaScript in summer green, the list goes on and you can customize it all. Enable the popular "Distraction-Free Mode", and see in Tree View only the files you have open (say goodbye to the interruption of long, intimidating folder structures not in use!).

# Installation
---
With the terminal open, key the following:

```shell
apm install climate-ui
```

Working on this theme is and will continue to be a passion project, but I'm just a dude -- a dude with a full-time job, a family to support and plenty of other adulting to adult. On the other hand, I'm a persistent developer. If you enjoy this theme, I'll do my best to honor that and continue to support Climate and your enthusiasm for as long and as best I can. But again... I'm just a dude -- a dude who likes coffee. If you love what you see and are so moved to show your support--and keep me awake and working--you're welcome to buy me a cup! I'd sure appreciate it!
